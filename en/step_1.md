title: About Discover projects
---

Discover projects are short 'taster' projects that can be completed in 10-15 minutes. They are a great way to try out a new technology and find out if you (or your club members) are ready to dive deeper into a 321 Make! path to develop skills and independence.

**Discover** projects are available as a one page printable which can be viewed online, as an offline pdf document or printed on paper.
