## What next?

Now you are ready to start [Intro to Web](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/web-intro) path. In this path, you will develop HTML and CSS skills leading up to an Invent project where you create a web page on a topic that you think is worth sharing. 

Start with the [Anime expressions](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/anime-expressions/) project where you will create a drawing tutorial web page.
